Visual row spacing and plant spacing requirements

Freeform row tool
Simplified Growth simulation
	Based on days to germination, maturity on seed packets
		(as estimated heat units required until stage is reached)
	Accumulation of heat units based on historical heat units
	Date slider - plant on certain date creates keyframe
	Moving slider will show plant growing (getting larger), fruit appearing, 
		Different plants can have different growth models
